What are the advantages and disadvantages of manual testing?
============================================================
Manual testing is advantageous because by manually working with the application, you may encounter bugs or issues that the programmer may not think of.  Similarly, its disadvantage is that because it's all manual, it takes quite a bit of time.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of automated testing?
===============================================================
Automated testing, unlike manual testing, is advantageous for its speed.  The programmer can think of the operations to test a feature or requirement and implement it directly.  However, certain paths or uses may be overlooked and thus remain untested.

What new bugs did you encounter with the new code?
==================================================
None whatsoever.

How many UI tests did you generate? How did you deteremine you had written enough?
==================================================================================
Including my setup and teardown functions, there are 10 methods, although only 8 of those are actual UI tests.  I determined that the tests were enough through manual testing, and examination of like qualities.  For instance, the last two requirements could be lumped into one test, since the operations were nearly identical.

How long did this lab take to accomplish?
=========================================
About 6 hours, give or take.
