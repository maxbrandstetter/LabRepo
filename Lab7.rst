Analysis Questions
******************

#. What bugs did you find?
#. What are the advantages and disadvantages of fuzz testing?
#. What was the hardest part of this lab?
#. How would you apply the concept of fuzz testing to testing a phone? a webpage? a library?
#. How could throttling fuzz test scripts help with finding bugs?
#. What is Delta Debugging and how would it help with fuzz testing?
#. If steps 1-20 were to produce an error using delta debugging what are the steps that 
   would arrive at steps 8, 12, 13, 19 and 20 being necessary to reproduce the error?
